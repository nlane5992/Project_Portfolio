My game engine is present in two different java packages, one for
each game created on them: A platformer & Snake. While a .jar or 
.exe would be desired for these, the server/client functionality 
along with the presence of scripting makes it rather complicated;
however, putting these in your own Java environment is very simple.

SETUP: instructions for both games are very similar: 1. download
the desired engineNDL_ folder and import into your desired IDE 
2. add the core.jar file to your java path (this is for Processing)
3. Run the server.java file within your game's folder 4. Run the 
client.java file in your game's folder. (optional 5. Start the 
client.java for as many players as desired)

PLAY: instructions differ between games:

For Platformer, jump with space and move with the arrow keys. The
slight goal of this game is to be the king of the hill on the 
floating square in the center of the map. Don't jump off the moving
platforms too quickly; however, because you might fall into the 
death pit on the side, causing you to respawn, starting all over.
There is almost nothing more fun than being a vibrant colored square 
that is the true king of the platformer hill!

For Snake, turn with the arrow keys and respawn with the spacebar.
Attempt to eat the multicolored fruit spawning around the map, and
in lieu of growth from eating fruit, the hazards instead are insta-
death wall touches and body pieces leaving by turning too quickly!
Be the safest most infinitely fed snake around in this awesome game!

Have fun everyone!
