## Welcome to the Home of Nathanael's Projects

Found within this github are a few of my game projects.
Thus far the collection holds: 
* Mad Jack - Text Based -> Created with Twine
* Mad Jack - Third Person -> Created with Gamemaker
* Snow Wars Online (Readme of how to get, as PC executables can't have virtual joysticks) -> Created with Unity
* Homemade Game Engine - Basic platformer and Snake game -> Created with Java/Processing
* Patchwork Conquest -> Created with Unreal
