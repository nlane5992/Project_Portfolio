To play Snow Wars Online, the easiest way is to download it off of the Google Play Store. 
This fun top-down snowball fight is completely free, takes very little storage, and can 
be found by searching "snowwars" (if a space is included it might not show up). Snow Wars 
is best enjoyed with a friends who can be coordinated to play with, as random players might
be hard to find given its small presence. After downloading and launching the app, a player
can choose to either start a game by selecting Local/Online or go to Options and subsequently
toggle music, change their player name, or use the tutorial. To start a game after selecting 
Local or Online, create a room and have the additional players join the hosted room. Finally, 
in game, use the left stick to move and the right stick to aim and fire until there is only
one team standing. Have Fun and Good Luck!
