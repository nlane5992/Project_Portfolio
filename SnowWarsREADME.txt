To play Snow Wars Online, the easiest way is to download it off of the Google Play Store. 
This fun top-down snowball fight is completely free, takes very little storage, and can 
be found by searching "snowwars". Although searching with a space between the names may not
properly find the game, the proper app icon consists of a snowball with a red "S" on the left
and a blue "W" on the right and is made by Koobando Interactive. To play, Snow Wars is best 
enjoyed with a friends who can be coordinated to play with, as random players might be hard
to find given its small presence. However, if no other players are available, there is a mode
within the options page for "Target Practice", enabling a way to slightly play the game in 
single player. After downloading and launching the app, a player can choose to either start 
a game by selecting Local/Online or go to Options to subsequently toggle music, change their
player name, or use the tutorial and "Target Practice" modes. To start a game after selecting 
Local or Online, create a room and have the additional players join the hosted room. Finally, 
in game, use the left stick to move and the right stick to aim and fire until there is only
one team standing. Have Fun and Good Luck!
